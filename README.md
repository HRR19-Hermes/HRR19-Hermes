# Hermes Calendar

> Sometimes life gets too hectic and you lose track of what you have to do and the time available to do it.  Hermes intelligently schedules your commitments into your existing calendar offering you more freedom and time to do the things that matter most to you.

## Usage

> This is a React based smart planner application created to simplify your life. Contribute to our project through our github at https://github.com/HRR19-Hermes/HRR19-Hermes

## Requirements

- Node
- React
- PostgreSQL
- Express
- Webpack

## Development

We have been hard at work through developing this for our Hack Reactor Remote Greenfield project time period. This was done as our first group project using agile methodology to create an smart calendar app.

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
1. npm install
2. install and run postgres - if you don't know how to do that please follow directions in PostgreSQL setup below
3. npm run webpack-build
(If you want a server just for the frontend work, npm devstart should work)
```

# PostgreSQL install and Local setup
You'll need to run through each of these steps in order and very carefully to get postgres installed locally for local testing.

1. Install postgres with homebrew: `brew install postgresql`
2. Start up the server and start the log: `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start`
3. Do the initial configuration: `initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8`
4. Create the database: `createdb`
  * There may be an issue where the database is not created. Once, postgress did not correctly install the *'example'* or *'test'* database and that had to be solved by manually creating one.
5. Do a global instal of psql (this is the postgres CLI): `npm install -g psql`
6. Start up the sql CLI: `psql -h localhost`
  * If there is an issue here, kill all postgres processes by listing them `ps aux | grep post`, then uninstall postgres and psql, and try the instructions again.

After initial setup you *should* be able to use `psql` to open the postgres CLI prompt.

once finally running [this](https://gist.github.com/Kartones/dd3ff5ec5ea238d4c546) is a great resource for psql commands.

# Postgres use

### Open the psql CLI

You may need to start the server after you have installed on your local machine, the run `psql -h localhost` or `psql` in a new terminal tab.

### Using Postgres psql CLI

This is a great cheat sheet for using the Postgres database: [Postgres Cheat Sheet](https://gist.github.com/Kartones/dd3ff5ec5ea238d4c546)

# File structure

### Models
This is where we are keeping all of the models for the project.

### Models/index.js
This index file is what will be used to get/access all of the models. It goes through the Models directory and grabs each of the models in it. It will then add each as a key of the export. It is best to use `var models = require("./models");` and then `models.users` to get access to whichever model you want instead of directly accesssing it.

# Database functions
Require db/database.js to get db utility functions.

| Function Name      | api url                | Method| Input                        | Output        |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------|------------------------------|---------------|
| addUser            | /api/users             | PUT   | {user obj}                   | {added user}  |
| getAllUsers        | /api/users             | GET   |                              | [{user},{},{}]|
| deleteAUser        | /api/users/:user_id    | DELETE| id as 1 or '1'               | 0 or 1        |
| getAUser           | /api/users/:user_id    | GET   | id as 1 or '1'               | {user}        |
| updateAUser        | /api/users/:user_id    | PUT   | id as 1 or '1' , {properties}| 0 or 1        |
| addTask            | /api/tasks             | PUT   | {task obj}                   | {added task}  |
| getAllTasks        | /api/tasks             | GET   |                              | [{task},{},{}]|
| deleteATask        | /api/tasks/:task_id    | DELETE| id as 1 or '1'               | 0 or 1        |
| getATask           | /api/tasks/:task_id    | GET   | id as 1 or '1'               | {task}        |
| updateATask        | /api/tasks/:task_id    | PUT   | id as 1 or '1' , {properties}| 0 or 1        |
| getAllTasksForAUser| /api/usertasks/:user_id| GET   | user id as 1 or '1'          | [{task},{},{}]|

*0 or 1 outputs indicate either failure (0) or success (1)*

#Schema
Here is the schema for the 2 current tables. 10/24 last updated

### Task

| id           | title | description |           start            |            end              | userId                |
|--------------|-------|-------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Number, Auto | string| string      | javascript date time object|  javascript date time object| foreign key from users|

Example for an entry would be (do not include id) `{title: 'test title', description: 'test description', startTime: new Date(), endTime: new Date(1477439896372), userId: 5}`

Start and end can take either a javacscript date time object or a number corresponding to a date time.

### User

| id           | username | password |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| Number, Auto | string   | string   |

There is currently no hashing being done on the passwords. Theses are mostly here as placeholders. Example entry (do not include id) `{username: 'XxSweetUserName87xX', password: '1337Password'}`

# Heroku Postgres

## index.js connection

The connection has been modified to check for the **HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_IVORY_URL** enviornment variable. If it is defined, we change the connection type to work with Heroku. The match regex pulls out several different parameters from the enviornment variable that is set.

## Looking into psql on Heroku

*Heroku may not support the uerId that is getting added in throught the relational declarations on database.js*

Start by running `heroku pg:psql` in a terminal, this will open up a psql prompt that is connected to heroku.

You can see the name spaces by using `\dt`

~~If you try to search for something it may not work. So you'll need to set the search path: `SET search_path = '<name space found Owner>';`~~

Open postgres psql on deployment: `heroku pg:psql COLOR_URL_NAME`
May also need to specify the app: `heroku pg:psql COLOR_URL_NAME --app app-name-1234`


Then open [http://localhost:1337/](http://localhost:1337/) to see your app.

# Webpack

We are looking to setup webpack so that you will be able to run/use it without having to install it globally.

Each time you make a change to the REACT app you'll need to rebuiuld the bundle.js file. Currently, webpack builds it in a _dev_ mode that makes it about 2MB. We've added bundle.js to the .gitignore so you shouldn't have to worry when trying to add files.

### Rebuilding Bundle.js

To rebuild the bundle run `npm run webpack-build`. That will start a script to rebuild webpack and start up nodemon for port 1337.

~~**Lucas** is working on trimming down the bundle.js file and getting a production bundle.js going.~~

Got the bundle.js cut down from 2MB to ~350KB. Line 1 is commented out and is how the code is meant to be run. On line 2 we are forcing the webpack.config to run as if it were in a dev enviornment. Choose which you need to use as needed.

# Git goodies

Got sick of running `npm install` after rebasing. Run this command in your terminal to use `gitup` to do everything for you:
`echo "alias gitup='git pull --rebase upstream master && npm install'" >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile && echo '\e[31mgitup\e[39m command ready'`

Then use `gitup` on your `master` branch.

# TODO:

- in db functions, need to return an error for specific lookups (getATask, deleteAUser, updateA etc...) that do not return a result. (when there is nothing in the database for the lookup)
- Enable automatic Heroku deployment off of Hermes master branch.
- Write instructions for manual Heroku pushes/testing
- Add testing folder that tests all functions, all api calls, any other server stuff, and the front end.
- Add authentication for users.
- Add signup for users.
- Protect calendar view with Authentication.

---
# Testing:

- Run Mocha
- db functions
- api calls
- locally everything is working
- on deployment user api calls are working, but userId is not found in task table.

# Heroku fun
[Adding users to the heroku app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/collaborating)
`heroku access:add user@email.com`

Open a terminal to deployment: `heroku run bash`
You may need to specify the app: `heroku run bash --app app-name-1234`
